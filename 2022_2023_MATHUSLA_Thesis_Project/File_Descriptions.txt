1. CAD Models:

- SiPM Connector v2:
	- Base.stl
	- Main.stl
	- Sandwich1.stl
	- Sandwich2.stl

The SiPM Connector v2 is the adapter piece to hold a 1.5 mm WLS fibre flush against a SiPM readout board. The connector consists of the 3D printed parts in the folder and 2 O-Rings with inner diameter 0.042” and outer diameter 0.140”. The critical element of the design is the compression of the O-Rings between the Sandwich parts and the Main component — if redesigning, make sure that the holes the WLS fibre is threaded through are filleted.

- Stopper.stl:

The stopper is used in the prototype module frame to support the sliding functionality. It is inserted between the C-rail legs and the double T-rail posts that the upper tracking layers are attached to prevent the posts from swinging outwards. In the current demonstrator module, this component is not used.

- 5537T441_T-Slotted Framing and 5537T935_T-Slotted Framing

These are T-rail corner bracket connections. The original CAD models can be found on McMaster Carr.

2. Notes on the demonstrator module:

The demonstrator module consists of two parts: an inner frame and outer frame. The inner frame is where 4 scintillating tracking  layers would be installed while the outer frame provides support to the inner frame and holds the bottom scintillating tracking layer. When adjusting the height of the module, be sure to do it with two people.

Step 1. Loosen the screws connecting to the vertical C-rails of the diagonal braces on the outer frame (each side should have one single brace and one double brace).

Step 2. Raise or lower the inner frame to the desired height. This will require two people. It may be a bit difficult to move the inner frame so check to make sure that outer braces are sufficiently loosened. Also, avoid stepping on the bottom layer when lifting the inner frame.

Step 3. Tighten the metal corner brackets resting on the top of the C-rails that connect to the double T-rail of the inner frame.

Step 4. While one person continues to support the inner frame, tighten the outer frame's diagonal braces that were loosened in Step 1.

Step 5. Loosen the metal corner brackets that were tightened in Step 3.



Code
- DAQTools.py: Helper functions for processing the data collected from the CAEN DAQ board when doing ToF measurements

- Pulse Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for doing pulse analysis of the signal generated by the SiPM. The output pulses are read out by dedicated SiPM readout boards like the Broadcom board. The notebook was for checking the quality of the SiPM signal and identifying noise sources that may have contaminated signal quality

- Time_Spectrum_Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for ToF measurement analysis. Code in the notebook is a bit outdated, especially when it concerns functions for ToF processing — see DAQTools.py for more up to date scripts. 

In a few of the notebooks, the module pycrp is imported. This is an analysis package used by the SuperCDMS group which contains some convenient pulse fitting functions. Ask for more details about getting the module.



Thesis Presentation is a presentation of the work that was completed for the project. 

The sample data folder contains pulse data of the SiPM pre-amp signal as well as time of flight data that can be tested with the processing functions included. For more ToF data, see https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1U7i68lOZkdaordBtxntpSdoAqBLFz3hd?sort=13&direction=a.
