this data was recorded using the BCF 9299A 1.2 mm WLSF at different distances from the detectors, and the sensL J-series model 30035 SiPM.

each folder corresponds to measurements taken to compare the leading edge timing method and the constant fraction discrimination timing method. Each folder
contains both datasets for a given distence between the laser pulser and Channel 1.

Naming of files:

1) SNSL_sipm_delay_xx_tmin: data taken over 10 mins of the maximum at each 500ms interval. 
    - xx: distance from Ch1 to the Pulse (cm)
    - t: how long the dataset was taken for, in minutes (min)

2) SNSL_sipm_trace_xx_yshots: trace data taken
    - xx: distance from Ch1 to the Pulse (cm)
    - y: numbers of traces taken
